char: 1 bytes
int: 4 bytes
double: 8 bytes(by deafault these dates are signed bit)
Note by default these data are signed bit
Float: 4 bytes (By default stores 6 digits of precision
Manipulators:
1.The one that change sign(signed,unsigned)
2.The one that changes size(short,long)
Note: By default int is long int and thus also int is long and signed
Long long int: 8 bytes
short int: 2 bytes
KEYWORDS:
for,while,do(loops)
Switch,case,default(to implement choosing between the options)
if,else(to implement binary condition)
break-it takes the control out of the block
continue-to skip the remaining instructions of the current iteration and continue with the next
return-to return back to the coller(callinf function). Alternatively we can return the value also
struct,union,enum-to create user defined datatypes
static-to create a global variable with file scope and to create a local variable with life till end of the program
void-to mention that function doesn't return a value
extern-to use an external variable(global variable declared in some other file)
constant-to create a read only variable(constant variable)
OPERATORS:
1.Arithmetic operators: +,-,*,/ 
All are binary operators(which takes 2 operands)
inputs are numbers
output is number
2.Evaluates from left to right
eg: in x+y-z: x+y is evaluated first
3. + and - has lesser precendence(priority)
the associtivity is over written by precendence of operators
in x-y%z: y%z is evaluated first
in every operation datatypes of the operands must be same
infix notation is used
the evaluation of any arithematic expression written in infix notation is then converted into postfix evaluation and then evaluated
